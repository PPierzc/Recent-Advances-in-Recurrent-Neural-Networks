\section{Conclusion}
%
Cortical microcircuits have complex network architectures which support extensive dynamics, however their computational power is yet to be understood. Making sense of excitatory and inhibitory interactions is outside the scope of current experimental approaches, albeit being known that they interact closely in the porcessing of sensory information. It has been shown that biologically constrained LSTMs could perform similarly to generic LSTMs and these subtractively gated excitation-inhibition recurrent neural networks show promise for the future research. It is expected that some biological tricks of the cortical networks may boost LSTMs performance in the future.
