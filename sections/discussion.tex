\section{Discussion}
It is important to note that subLSTMs do not outperform traditional LSTMs, however they show that biology might be a good source of information for the future.
On the other hand the proposed model subLSTM and cortical model are in general a very vague abstraction of the real cortical processing, concentrating on solely one aspect of the biological network, which is the subtractive gating. There is much more complexity to the system than it is presented, as the Dale's principle (a given neuron can only be inhibitory or excitatory) was omitted as well as the shunting inhibition. The authors of the work however mention those as the next step in the their work is attempting to include more biological principles.
What is more all the models and results were implemented by the authors, leaving to wonder if the state-of-the-art implementations wouldn't have drawn a less positive picture for biologically constrained implementations.
